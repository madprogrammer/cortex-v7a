# cortex-v7a

Low level access to 32-bit Cortex-A processors. Based on [cortex-a](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-a)

_This repository is not meant to provide extensive support for Cortex-A processors, and you probably shouldn't use it.
It would be a better approach to include proper AArch32 support to the original [cortex-a](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-a)
but I just needed a solution right now so I made this quick fork to fulfill immediate needs._
